Suiviclair - Supply Chain Tracking DApp
Suiviclair is a blockchain-based solution for transparent, secure, and traceable supply chain management. Leveraging Starknet for smart contract interaction, Calimero SDK for private shard interaction, and a WASM file created with Rust, Suiviclair ensures that sensitive shipment data remains protected while providing real-time visibility into the supply chain process.

Features
Real-Time Shipment Tracking: Track shipments at every stage from origin to destination.
Secure Data Sharing: Use private blockchain shards via Calimero SDK to protect sensitive information.
Transparency & Immutability: Blockchain guarantees that every action is recorded immutably.
End-to-End Traceability: Full transparency from the moment a shipment is created to its final delivery.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Built using Starknet Scaffold, a framework for quickly developing decentralized apps (DApps) on Starknet.
Smart Contracts: Written in Cairo for Starknet, ensuring high scalability and decentralization.
Private Shard Interaction: Calimero SDK to safeguard sensitive data while interacting with the private blockchain shards.
Backend Logic: Implemented in Rust with Borsh serialization for efficient and secure data storage and retrieval.
Project Structure
Frontend: Starknet Scaffold provides the frontend for interacting with the Suiviclair smart contracts deployed on Starknet.
Smart Contracts: The core logic of the application is implemented through a smart contract deployed on Starknet, written in Cairo.
WASM File: The backend logic for interacting with private shards is implemented in Rust using Calimero SDK, generating a WASM file for execution.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run Suiviclair locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (for frontend)
Rust (for compiling the WASM file)
Starknet CLI (for interacting with Starknet)
Calimero SDK (for secure private shard interactions)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/suviclair.git
cd suviclair
Install dependencies:

For the frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
For the Rust backend logic (WASM file):

bash
Copy code
cd backend
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
Start the frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Deploy smart contracts on Starknet (refer to the Starknet documentation).

Usage
Once the frontend is running, interact with the app via the user interface to create shipments, track their status, and view the history of shipments. The interaction with smart contracts on Starknet will ensure that all data is recorded and tracked securely.

Example WASM Code
The following Rust code demonstrates how the backend logic for tracking shipments is implemented using the Calimero SDK:
